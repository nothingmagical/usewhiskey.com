Whiskey is a Markdown text editor for Mac. It will work *neat* (plain Gruber style) or *on the rocks* (with extensions).

I have lots I want to do with this app. Stay tuned. (Please don't share this link.)

## Nerd Things

Part of this project is making my own parser. It started out as just for fun, but it's really coming along. It can do some really powerful stuff that no other ones can do (that I know of). Most things are supported, but here's a few things that still need to be wrapped up:

* Parse horizontal rules
* Parse link titles
* Parse Nested list items
* Better recursive parsing
* List containers
* Ordered lists
* Reference-style links
* Escaping

Thanks for checking out the Whiskey alpha. Please send feedback to <sam@soff.es>.
